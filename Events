When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

To assign event const startEvent = new Event("start"); 
---To trigger the event Listener document. addEventListener("start", () => { console. log("The start event was triggered") });
---To trigger the Event document. dispatchEvent(startEvent);

Example <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
