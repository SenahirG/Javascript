Conditional Statement

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
Example. if(total > 85) 
{ Grade = "A" ;}

Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
if (total > 85;
{
Grade = "A";}
else{
Grade = "B";}

Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
if (total > 85;){
Grade = "A";}
else if (total > 75;){
Grade = "B";}
else { Grade = "C";}

Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.
Example 
The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.
(Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 ..)

switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
    day = "Sunday";
    break;
  case 1:
    day = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
     day = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    day = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    day = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    day = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    day = "Saturday";
}
