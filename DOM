The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. 
The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites.
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects.
With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML.
- JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page.
- JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page.
- JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
