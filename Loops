LOOPS
Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
eg. for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}

for/in - loops through the properties of an object
eg. const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

let text = "";
for (let x in person) {
  text += person[x];
}

for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
eg. const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
eg. while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
eg. do {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
while (i < 10);
